# Image Classification using LSTM 

The objective of an Image Classification Model is to be accurate. Why would someone use any sort of technology if it had a really large range of error, and was wrong most of the time? It’s like asking your friend who is not very strong in math to do your math test for you — it just makes no sense whatsoever.

Using my knowledge of RNNs, I coded one that classifies images — which iterates, trains, and tests data for higher accuracy. The output of the code is the loss function and percentage accuracy for each epoch, so you can see how it increases with trial and error as the weights and biases are adjusted.
