# Chatbot

A deep learning chatbot learns right from scratch through a process called “Deep Learning.” 
In this process, the chatbot is created using machine learning algorithms. 
A deep learning chatbot learns everything from its data and human-to-human dialogue.

The chatbot is trained to develop its own consciousness on the text, and you can teach it how to converse with people. 
Alternatively, you can teach the chatbot through movie dialogue or play scripts. 
However, a human-to-human conversation is the preferred way to create the best possible deep learning chatbot. 
Remember, the more data you have, the better the effectiveness of machine learning will be.
