# Recurrent Neural Networks

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a form of machine learning algorithm that are ideal for 
sequential data such as text, time series, financial data, speech, audio, video among others.

RNNs are ideal for solving problems where the sequence is more important than the individual items themselves.

An RNNs is essentially a fully connected neural network that contains a refactoring of some of its layers into a loop. 
That loop is typically an iteration over the addition or concatenation of two inputs, a matrix multiplication and a non-linear function.
