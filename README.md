## Deep Natural Language Processing

Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of computer science that studies how computers and humans interact. In the 1950s, Alan Turing published an article that proposed a measure of intelligence, now called the Turing test. More modern techniques, such as deep learning, have produced results in the fields of language modeling, parsing, and natural-language tasks.

This repository aims to to cover both traditional and deep learning based NLP tasks such as speech recognition, trigger word detection, question answering systems as well as more recent ones such as transfer learning techniques and unsupervised nlp, implemented in tensorflow and pytorch.
